<h3>2023+</h3>
<h4>Travels to Chile</h4>

<p>From Ric's email on January 12, 2023, to Val:</p>
<p>
The trip to Chile was a great success.  No getting bounced out of reserved airline seats or anything like that.  At the concert where Mahani played Grieg’s Piano Concerto (to a good sized audience) she also accompanied a soprano soloist in “The Road Not Taken” by a familiar CC perfessor.  And with all that, we had nice weather at Puerto Varas, Helen’s new home.  Jo and Larry accompanied me to Chile, and thanks to his fluency in Spanish we had no unhappy adventures.  It was a delightful 3 weeks.

<h3> 2023 October:  Ric's Last Trip</h3>
<p>Ric, with Helen escorting, set off on what was to be his last trip. Ric and Helen flew from Colorado Springs to Seattle. Scott picked them up at SEA/TAC and brought them to San Juan Island.  We had a terrific 4 days with Ric and Helen, exploring the island, talking and singing. </p>
	
<p>  We all then went to Seattle.  Ric and Helen had a good visit with Estella Leopold, Dorry's sister.  On Saturday, Tahai joined Helen and Ric and we all attended Mahani's Seattle concert. Mahani played before a large crowd at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony.</p>	

<p> Ric followed along for concerts in New Hampshire and there he seemed to weaken. Then, in Cleveland, Ric had to be taken to the emergency room.</p>
<p> Ric died on Saturday, October 28th, at age 101.5, in Cleveland while the granddaughter whom he so admired and loved was in concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.</p>
