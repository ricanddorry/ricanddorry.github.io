<h4>Travels to Chile</h4>

<p>From Ric's email on January 12, 2023, to Val:</p>
<p>
The trip to Chile was a great success.  No getting bounced out of reserved airline seats or anything like that.  At the concert where Mahani played Grieg’s Piano Concerto (to a good sized audience) she also accompanied a soprano soloist in “The Road Not Taken” by a familiar CC perfessor.  And with all that, we had nice weather at Puerto Varas, Helen’s new home.  Jo and Larry accompanied me to Chile, and thanks to his fluency in Spanish we had no unhappy adventures.  It was a delightful 3 weeks.
